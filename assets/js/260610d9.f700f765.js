This\nyear edition\u2019s tagline was \u201ca clean start\u201d.

The tech-comm scene in Poland is still in its\ninfancy and it\u2019s up to us what shape and form it will take in the near future.\nThis is not an easy task, as there is barely anything to build on. However, as\nPawe\u0142 tried to convince his audience, this is actually a good thing, because\nwithout all the unnecessary baggage of the past, we can shape the Polish\ntechnical communication in any way we want. After that, Pawe\u0142 moved on to\ndiscuss various directions the technical documentation is heading to. According\nto him, it\u2019s main focus should be on the client instead of the product. The\nusers expect information, that will allow them to quickly start using the\nproduct, that will display only when needed, and is easily searchable.

Instead, they have\nembedded short multimedia presentations into the product website itself, that\nconcisely illustrate the capabilities of their product.
