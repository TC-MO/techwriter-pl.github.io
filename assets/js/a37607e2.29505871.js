She started her presentation\nwith a story about a cat called Teodor who wanted to help its owner and do the\nlaundry. For a moment we were wondering where the story was going. The finale\nwas quite drastic because Teodor almost died buried under a voluminous and\nbadly-written manual. Monika tried to show how to avoid such tragedies. As we\u2019ve\nalready heard more than once, manuals are too long, too boring, and\nincomprehensible. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s difficult to find a common denominator for\nthe readers of the manual because each of us pays attention to different\ndetails, and the way we use a particular product often depends on how much\nexperience we have with it. Additionally, there are problems of linguistic\nnuances and a high context culture, like the Polish one. The first step to\nsolving these issues is creating the user profile and narrowing down the\ncharacteristics of the target audience. You also have to put yourself in the\nuser\u2019s shoes, try to create potential stress situations to understand how the\nuser might feel in such moments and what information he or she will need. Monika\nalso tried to convince us that technical documentation does not have to be\nboring. It\u2019s enough to give it characteristics of a novel and write it so that\nwe would want to read it ourselves. Everyone wants to feel like a superhero.\nAccording to Monika, we should use this fact to our advantage and create\ndocumentation that makes users feel that each thing they learn from that\ndocumentation gives them new superpowers. Apart from the novel aspect, we also\nheard about introducing elements of a game into documents, a.k.a. gamification.\nThe mere addition of ranks and badges is no longer sufficient as the users get\nbored quickly. It\u2019s possible to introduce microgames - smaller challenges that\nthe user can undertake - or exploration of the interface where a particular\naction triggers a response from the system and allows for discovering new\nfunctions. Monika\u2019s examples of increasing the attractiveness of documentation\nby introducing elements of novels and games included a comic book for Ruby\nprogrammers, ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.ribbonhero.com/"},"Ribbon Hero 2")," \u2013 the great return of\nthe well-known Clippy from MS Office, and the\n",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://stackoverflow.com/"},"Stack Overflow portal"),"."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapMonikaKonieczny.jpg"},(0,o.kt)("img",{alt:"SoapMonikaKonieczny",src:n(23676).Z,width:"570",height:"57"}))),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"plenty-is-sometimes-a-plague"},"Plenty is sometimes a plague"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"As we were told by ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://soapconf.com/speakers/"},"Kasia Mrowca"),", the same is\nthe case for a surplus of functions in an application. Clients always want to\nadd many new functionalities to their app. Before we satisfy their needs, we\nshould stop for a moment and think where their requirements come from. Sometimes\nthe problem lies in the process and adding a new option to the interface doesn\u2019t\nchange anything. It\u2019s the process that needs to be modified. Sometimes new\nfunctions are requested out of habit. Someone has always had one switch or the\nother in the previous software and wants to have the same one in the new\napplication even though it\u2019s completely unnecessary. Kasia mentioned the pareto\nrule according to which 80% of users use only 20% of functions, Microsoft Word\ncan be an example here. Each new function makes the application more complex. It\ntranslates into its usability and the level of complexity of the accompanying\ndocumentation. One has to know the limit just like with eating chocolate.

After each part we had to choose what\nshould happen next thus deciding how the story developed. Unfortunately, we\nkilled the main hero. However, this wasn\u2019t the most important thing. What really\nmattered was that we could learn without feeling bored. Before we start creating\na training we need to specify the target audience and the level of their\ncomputer literacy as it impacts how they will feel during the course. Sabina\nreferred to, among others,\n",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.learning-theories.com/kellers-arcs-model-of-motivational-design.html"},"the ARCS didactic model"),".\nThe main factor which keeps the users\u2019 attention during the training is their\nmotivation. It\u2019s also important how relevant to them are the skills that they\nare going to gain during the training. We can build user confidence by informing\nthem how long the training will last, what form it will have, and what hardware\nwill be required. The level of satisfaction can be increased by adding funny\nelements, interesting images and elements of a game. In the past, the strategy\nof creating e-learnings assumed a smaller number of long courses. Currently, the\ntrend is to create a bigger number of shorter courses, games, videos, or\ninfographics. During the presentation, Sabina provided many interesting\nexamples. One of them was an introductory course for new employees in the form\nof a game. Another example was ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://life-saver.org.uk"},"Lifesaver")," \u2013 a game\nin the form of a movie that teaches how to make proper choices in emergency\nsituations that we can encounter in everyday life."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapSabinaMisiarzFilipek.png"},(0,o.kt)("img",{alt:"SoapSabinaMisiarzFilipek",src:n(46558).Z,width:"570",height:"65"}))),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"the-power-of-the-diagram"},"The power of the diagram"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"It has long been known that \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words.\u201d This old\ntruth was demonstrated by ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://soapconf.com/speakers/"},"Kevin Duncan"),', who\nshowed how to skilfully use diagrams to make stories we tell more interesting\nand concise. One such method is the \u201cwhittling wedge\u201d. We start from a wide\nrange of options, approximately 10, then narrow the choice down to around 3\noptions. In the end we recommend one of them. Another method is the \u201cbow tie\u201d.\nWe start our story from a few options, recommend one of them and then move on to\na broader discussion expanding the details. A diagram that shows the\n"motivational dip" is also an interesting example. At the beginning, when we\ntake on something new, we experience a rapid increase in motivation, which lasts\nup to a point. Then comes the decline in motivation and the stabilization phase\nduring which we learn. This phase may end with either success or failure. In\norder to streamline our activities we can use the \u201cpriority matrix\u201d. With the\nhelp of four criteria - urgent, not urgent, important and unimportant \u2013 we\ndivide the area into four sections. The first one includes matters which are\nurgent and unimportant and can be delegated or performed straightaway. The\nsecond section contains urgent and important matters that we need to address\nimmediately. The third section covers matters which are not urgent and not\nimportant. They can be ignored. The last section contains issues that are not\nurgent but important. They must be considered and planned.
