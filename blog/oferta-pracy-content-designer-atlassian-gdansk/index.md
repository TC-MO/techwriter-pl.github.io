## Content Designer

Gdansk, Poland â€¢ Customer Experience â€¢ Full Time

**Atlassian is continuing to hire with all interviewing and on-boarding done
virtually due to COVID-19. All new and existing Atlassians will continue to work
from home until itâ€™s safe to return to our offices. When our offices re-open,
every Atlassian will have the choice to work from an office or from home.**

Information is a powerful and crucial element of the user experience. If that
statement makes your eyes light up, you might be who we're looking for!

At Atlassian, we look at the way we communicate technical information to our
customers as an end-to-end journey. This journey begins with our customers and
their needs, continues through the discovery and purchasing process to learning
our products, and ends with just enough content to guide our customers or solve
their problems.

This isn't a traditional technical writing role. As a member of the Design team,
you'll be empowered to experiment with a variety of approaches to presenting and
managing information.

This job is for someone who thinks bigger than traditional software
documentation. You can explain complex features and communicate value in a
compelling, clear, and effective way. You're ready to be responsible for the
information experience for their customer journey and contribute to projects
that benefit the larger documentation community here at Atlassian.

On the first day, you'd be expected to have:

- excellent writing and communication skills,
- experience writing product documentation for technical audiences,
- experience writing in-app copy,
- experience working with multi-disciplinary teams including designers,
  developers, product managers, analysts, marketing, and customer support teams,
- experience working in and managing documentation projects in an agile,
  fast-paced environment.

And ideally, we'd hope you'd have:

- a knack for creatively engaging with audiences,
- experience working on cross-product documentation,
- experience with conducting and using research insights to improve
  content-driven experiences,
- an ability to challenge yourself and others,
- experience in improving or building information architectures and content
  strategies,
- bonus points if you have experience working on developer or service desk
  documentation.

**Our team**

We believe information is critical to any user experience. When you join
Atlassian as a Content Designer (CD), you become part of the Atlassian Design
organization. Content Design includes everything needed to understand, support,
market, and use that product. You won't own all the content, but you'll help
make sure the stories we tell are consistent and create a great experience for
our customers.

**More about our benefits**

Whether you work in an office or a distributed team, Atlassian is highly
collaborative and yes, fun! To support you at work (and play) we offer some
fantastic perks: ample time off to relax and recharge, flexible working options,
five paid volunteer days a year for your favourite cause, an annual allowance to
support your learning & growth, unique ShipIt days, a company paid trip after
five years and lots more.

environment.
