# Junior Content Designer

Gdansk, Poland • Customer Experience • Full Time

**Atlassian is continuing to hire with all interviewing and on-boarding done virtually due to COVID-19. All new and existing Atlassians will continue to work from home until it’s safe to return to our offices. When our offices re-open, every Atlassian will have the choice to work from an office or from home.**

Information is a powerful and crucial element of the user experience. If that statement makes your eyes light up, you might be who we're looking for.

At Atlassian, we see at the way we communicate technical information to our customers as an end-to-end journey. This journey begins with our customers and their needs, continues through the discovery and purchasing process to learning our products, and ends with just enough content to guide our customers or solve their problems. We know that good writing and software are not always considered synonymous, and we're on a mission to change that.

This isn't a traditional technical writing role. As a member of the Design team, you'll be empowered to experiment with a variety of approaches to presenting and managing information. Have you ever found yourself rewriting in-app copy, or product tutorials in your head? If so, Atlassian's Content Design team might be a good place for you to grow. Join us and have a direct impact on how millions of users collaborate and use software every single day.

**More about you**

This job is for someone who doesn’t necessarily have experience but wants to dive into the world of software development, design, and content strategy. If you can explain complex products and solutions and communicate value in a compelling, clear, and effective way, don’t wait to apply! We look for people from a range of disciplines and backgrounds such as English Philology, Media, Design, Technical Writing, Linguistics, Computer Science, Customer Support, and more.

When you join the team, you'd be expected to have:

- a talent for writing
- good communication skills
- willingness to work with multi-disciplinary teams including designers, developers, product managers, analysts, marketing, and customer support engineers
- an ability to challenge yourself and others

Ideally, you’d have:

- an appetite to learn
- attention to detail
- bonus points if you have experience working on any type of content

**More about our benefits**

Our offices are open, highly collaborative and yes, fun! To support you at work (and play), we offer some phenomenal perks: plenty of food and beverages, ergonomic workstations with sit/stand desks, flexible working hours, unique innovation days, monthly company events, and more.

**More about Atlassian**

Software is changing the world, and we’re at the center of it all. With a customer list that reads like a who's who in tech, and a highly disruptive business model, we’re advancing the art of team collaboration with products like Jira Software, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Trello. Driven by honest values, an amazing culture, and consistent revenue growth, we’re out to unleash the potential of every team. From Amsterdam and Austin to Sydney and San Francisco, we’re looking for people who are powered by passion and eager to do the best work of their lives in a highly autonomous yet collaborative, no B.S. environment.

**Additional Information**

We believe that the unique contributions of all Atlassians is the driver of our success. To make sure that our products and culture continue to incorporate everyone's perspectives and experience we never discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, or marital, veteran, or disability status.

All your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines.
