## Technical Writer

GDANSK, POLAND / CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE / FULL TIME

---

Atlassian can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity, assuming
candidates have eligible working rights and a sufficient timezone overlap with
their team. As our offices re-open, Atlassians can choose to work remotely or
return to an office, unless it’s necessary for the role to be performed in the
office. Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a
distributed-first company.

Information is a powerful and essential element of the user experience. For
builders developing apps, it’s the same tablestakes – without great
documentation, it is nearly impossible to build new apps, services, and
products.

This journey begins as developers get started with building on the Atlassian
stack, and ends with a living set of reference materials that answer any
question they may have as they build, launch, monitor, and support their work.
The mission of the Content Design in Ecosystem is to guide everyone who uses the
Atlassian platform to confidently meet their goals. We're on the lookout for a
writer to build well-crafted experiences paired with technical documentation for
Atlassian's Developer Platform.

At Atlassian, we look at the way we communicate technical information to our
internal and third-party developers as an end-to-end journey. We empower teams
to experiment with a variety of approaches to creating information in the
documentation, supporting materials, and anywhere else our developers experience
information.

### More about you

The Ecosystem team is distributed, and we embrace an environment of asynchronous
communication. You'll need strong communication skills and the ability to build
working relationships with coworkers in locations around the globe.

As a Content Designer, you are an adept communicator, able to provide reviews on
the content their team members build. You can explain complex features and
capabilities in ways that are useful for experienced audiences, but which are
also helpful and approachable for more novice readers getting into the domain or
learning a new API. You have the ability to be empathetic as a writer and are
able to put yourself in the user's position to help tackle problems before
they're asked. In this role, you'll create a range of content from getting
started guides and examples to overarching content in our Shift team within
Ecosystem Platform. You will also get the chance to work with our world-class
technical writing team on in-depth documentation of technical features.

### When you join the team, you would be expected to have:

- ability to create high-quality user-facing content for software,
- be a strong user advocate, especially for new developers and partners,
- ability to compassionately give and receive editorial and technical feedback,
- ability to plan, prioritize, and carry out sophisticated writing projects with
  high attention to detail along the way,
- excellent communication skills, especially when working with a distributed
  team,
- proficiency in technical writing skills,
- familiarity with standard web-based publishing tools (e.g., Markdown, HTML,
  CSS, XML),
- familiarity with standard developer tools (e.g., Git, Bitbucket, Bamboo),
- experience documenting APIs, writing code samples, tutorials, and other
  technical content related to building or extending products and apps.

### And ideally, you would have:

- a background in engineering/software development,
- ability to read, write, and verify code samples (e.g., JavaScript, Java,
  Python),
- a knack for creatively engaging with developer audiences,
- experience working on cross-product documentation,
- the ability to challenge yourself and others,
- experience in improving or building both information architectures and content
  strategies for documentation,
- experience with usability testing, card sorting, journey mapping, and other
  techniques to ensure that your work is not just accurate, but that it is also
  effective for your target audience.

success. To make sure that our products and culture continue to incorporate

orientation, age, or marital, veteran, or disability status.
