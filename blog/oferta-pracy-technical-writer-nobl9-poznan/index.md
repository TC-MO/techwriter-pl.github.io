**Why work at Nobl9?**

Now more than ever our lives depend on digital services and Nobl9 is on a
mission to make them reliable and efficient. Our category-defining Service Level
Objective (SLO) platform is gaining traction with many organizations that care
about service excellence. If you like working on hard problems that can have a
massive impact and want to join a fast-growing startup that is helping
organizations improve the reliability of their software this is the place for
you.

We operate in two locations, the US and Poland, with Poznań being the
headquarters of our Engineering Team. Our squad consists of a wide range of IT
professionals, including software engineers, quality assurance specialists,
project managers, agile delivery managers, and product owners. As an
expansion-stage startup, we’re in constant need of more fuel to grow faster -
which is why we’re looking for new talents to join Nobl9!

Currently, we’re on the lookout for a **Technical Writer** who’ll swell the
ranks of our **Engineering Team in Poland (Poznan)**.

**In this role you will:**

- Become a part of the team which bring to life a product that makes a
  difference: an innovative Service Level Objectives (#SLOs) platform released
  publicly in January 2021

  technical discussions into compelling written content
- Write easy-to-understand user interface specification, user guides, and online
  content
- Produce high-quality documentation targeted at a technical audience
- Create tutorials to help end-users (mainly DevOps and Site Reliability
  Engineers) use our solutions
- Analyze existing and yet-to-be-written content with the view to identifying
  room for improvement
- Work in a friendly non-corporate atmosphere that prioritizes flexibility and
  autonomy over stiff procedures and fixed hierarchy
- Hone your skills daily as Site Reliability Engineering is still gaining
  traction and there is so much more to learn about it

**Here are the qualities we’d like you to possess:**

- Proven working experience in writing software documentation (please, do send
  us a portfolio featuring your best technical writing pieces)
- Experience working in the IT industry and a deep understanding of the software
  development process
- Ability to quickly grasp complex technical concepts and translate them into
  straightforward text and image
- Native-level written English
- Experience with DevOps or Developer Tools is a plus
- Outstanding communication skills in both Polish and English (the role requires
  close interaction with our teams located both in Poland and across the ocean)
- Team player skills

**What is Nobl9?**

Nobl9, the software reliability platform, is in the noble pursuit of reliable
software. We help software developers, DevOps practitioners, and reliability
engineers deliver reliable features faster. Through software-defined Service
Level Objectives (SLOs) we can help you link monitoring and other logging and
tracing data to user happiness and business KPIs.
